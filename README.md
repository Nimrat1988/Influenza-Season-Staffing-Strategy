Influenza Season Staffing Strategy

Objective - To support a medical staffing agency in planning for influenza season by analyzing national flu trends and identifying periods and regions with increased demand for temporary healthcare staff.

Key Questions:

  - Which states experience the highest demand for additional medical staff?
  - Which population groups are most affected and at highest risk during flu season?
  - When does flu season peak, and how long does the high-demand period typically last?

Data Sources and Preparation

Data 

  - Influenza deaths by geography sourced CDC.
  - Population data by geography, time, age and gender sourced US Census Bureau

Preparation

  - Performed data cleaning for both datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency by standardizing variables, correcting data types, handling missing values and performing data quality checks for completeness.
  - Performed statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate the relationship between vulnerable populations (65+) and flu related deaths across states.
  - Created visualizations in Tableau to identify trends, forecasts, and maps to show pattern overtime.
  - Prepared Tableau storyboard for stakeholders.

Key Insights
  - Older adults, especially 65 and above face the highest risk of severe illness and death during flu season.
  - California and New York have the  highest number of influenza deaths, indicating higher demand for medical staff.
  - Flu activity is highest during winter months, peeking from December to February.
  - Prioritize flu-season staffing on regions with large older populations and historically high case counts to ensure timely care and reduce healthcare strain.

Recommendations
  - Focus staffing and prevention efforts on adults aged 65+ who face the highest risk of severe flu outcomes.
  - Increase temporary staffing in high-need states such as California and New York, where flu-related deaths are consistently higher.
  - Start staffing and resource planning early, using historical flu trends to anticipate peak demand and reduce pressure on healthcare system.
